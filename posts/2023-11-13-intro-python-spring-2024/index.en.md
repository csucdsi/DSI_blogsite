We are excited to offer, for the first time, Introduction to Python as MATH 131 in spring 2024.  Like the sister course MATH 130 (Intro to R), this will be a 1 unit, credit / no credit course that only lasts the first 5 weeks of the semester.

**MATH 131 in spring 2024 will be Tuesday/Thursday from 2 - 3.15pm in Holt 277 from 01/22 to 02/23.**

No experience is necessary and the course is open to all majors who are interested in learning about computer programming.

```
import random
def will_you_join_us():
    return random.choice([“yes”, “no”, “idk, let me check..."])
```

The format of the course will be very similar to [MATH 130](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/), just ported into a new language.  We'll cover the same overall topics and end the course with a project to summarize the topics learned.

If you have any questions, shoot me, Edward, an email: [eroualdes@csuchico.edu](mailto:eroualdes@csuchico.edu).
