Welcome to the Chico State Data Science Certificate Capstone Project Showcase! This page highlights the innovative work of our talented students in the Data Science Certificate program. Projects span a diverse range from academic research, community collaborations, and real-world applications,  demonstrating the impact and creativity of our budding data professionals. Each project is linked directly to a Github repository with more details about the project, including if the project has good next steps that can be built on by another person.
